# Benchmark 1. Model-Based Systems Validation and Verification

This benchmark aims at building confidence in the usefulness of the new methods and tools with respect to the validation of specifications and the verification of designs. Qualitative and quantitative standardised metrics help to compare studies and to measure the technical progress.

## Requirements
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to detect missing requirements
