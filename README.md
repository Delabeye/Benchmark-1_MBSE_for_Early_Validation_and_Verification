# Benchmark 1. Model-Based Systems Validation and Verification

This benchmark aims at building confidence in the usefulness of the new methods and tools with respect to the validation of specifications and the verification of designs. Qualitative and quantitative standardised metrics help to compare studies and to measure the technical progress.

## Glossary

To share a common undestanding of ambiguous concepts, contributors shall agree upon the following definitions:
- Requirement: is the result of a formal transformation of one or more needs or parent requirements into an agreed-to obligation for an object to possess some property within specified constraints under some conditions with acceptable risk.
- Specification: A set of requirements.



- Validation: confirmation, through objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific indended use or application have been fulfilled. A system is able to accomplish its indended use, goals and objectives (i.e., meet stakeholder requirements) in the intended operational environment. The righ system was built.
- Design: Definition of the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system.
- Verification: confirmation, through objective evidence, that specified requirements have been fulfilled. 

## Requirements

- The solution shall enable systems engineers to specify correct requirements.
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to specify complete requirements.
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to specify correct specifications.
- The Solution shall enable systems engineers to specify complete specifications.
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to demonstrate that the designs meets the specifications.
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to demonstrate that the implementations meets the specifications.
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to vertically trace requirements.
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to horizontally trace requirements.
- The solution shall enable stakeholders, especially end-users, to experience the intended operational environment and the systems properties (behavioural and structural) with a high degree of realism
