# Benchmark 1. Model-Based Systems Validation and Verification

This benchmark aims at building confidence in the usefulness of the new methods and tools with respect to the validation of specifications and the verification of designs. Qualitative and quantitative standardised metrics help to compare studies and to measure the technical progress.

## Glossary

To share a common undestanding of ambiguous concepts, contributors shall agree upon the following definitions:
- Requirement:
- Specification:
- Validation: confirmation, through objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific indended use or application have been fulfilled. A system is able to accomplish its indended use, goals and objectives (i.e., meet stakeholder requirements) in the inteded operational environment. The righ system was built.
- Design: Definition of the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system element.
- Verification: confirmation, trhough objective evidence, that specified requirements have been fulfilled. 


## Requirements
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to detect missing requirements
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to detect conflicting requirements
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to verify that the design meets the requirements
- The solution shall enable systems engineers to trace requirements
- The solution shall enable systems enginners to ...
